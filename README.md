## AppIARY
*Bee Smart!*

AppIARY is my portfolio project for the ALX SE course. It is a web application that bee farmers can use to manage apiaries. It borrows heavily from *apimanager.net*

The app will allow you to manage beehives, perform inspections on beehives and record observations, schedule harvests, record harvests, and add or remove beehives.
